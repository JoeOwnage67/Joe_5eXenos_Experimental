# 5e Xenos
  
If you like my stuff, you can buy me a coffee (or a beer) at : https://ko-fi.com/joeownage  
  
This mod uses new genes and genes from existing mods to create or change xenotypes to bring them into line with DnD 5e races. I had discontinued this mod, believing that Forgotten Realms - Biotech Edition was superior, but there are still some people that want to use it so I have updated it. Also it uses Big & Small now, which many have requested. 
  
Wood Elf  
Dark Elf  
Hill Dwarf  
Mountain Dwarf

Illithid - just a name change and small gene tweak from the *Alpha Genes* mind devourer.  
Dragonborn - requires *Biotech Expansion - Mythic* loaded.  
Loxodon - requires *Biotech Expansion - Mammalia* loaded.  
Shifter - requires *Biotech Expansion - Mammalia* loaded.  
Troll - will come back in the future  
Halfling - will come back in the future  
Goblin - will come back in the future
  
There are mod options under Vanilla Expanded Framework that allow you to toggle *Biotech Expansion* xenotypes and factions on or off.

---Compatibility---  
Custom head types are not really compatible with Nal's Facial Animations, but there is a Facial Animations Xenotype Compatibility mod that aims to correct this. If not, you can turn off facial animations on certain xenotypes under the mod options for Nal's Facial Animations.  
  
I have marked a few mods as incompatible that add the same or similar stuff to what this mod is adding.
